A small project I completed for the course "Multimedia Technology" at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) of NTUA
The project is a Java application with a GUI (JavaFX) that implements an eLibrary system

The original instructions from the professor as well as a brief report that contains some cclarifications are included in the `documents` folder.

This project is for educational purposes.
